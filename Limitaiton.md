# Intergalactic Space Travel Booking Application

## Limitations

1. **Planetary Coverage**: The application currently supports a limited number of planets for interplanetary travel. As the number of planets and destinations grows, the backend and frontend need to be updated to accommodate this expansion.

2. **Flight Availability**: Flight availability data is assumed to be accurate and up-to-date. If there are discrepancies or changes in flight schedules, users may experience issues with booking and travel planning.

3. **User Load**: The application assumes a moderate user load during testing. It might require optimizations to handle high traffic, ensuring scalability and performance during peak usage times.

4. **Security Measures**: While the application includes basic user registration and authentication, advanced security features like two-factor authentication and data encryption are not implemented in the current version.

## Assumptions

1. **Database Reliability**: It's assumed that the underlying relational database system is reliable and properly configured. In the event of database failures or inconsistencies, the application's data integrity could be compromised.

2. **Email Delivery**: The email verification process relies on external email services. It's assumed that these services are reliable and capable of delivering verification emails in a timely manner.

3. **Responsive Design**: The frontend design assumes standard screen sizes for both iOS and Android devices. Extensive testing on various devices and screen sizes is necessary to ensure a consistent and responsive user experience.

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Security**: Implement advanced security features such as two-factor authentication, OAuth integration, and secure token storage to enhance user data protection.

2. **Dynamic Content**: Allow users to dynamically add and manage their travel preferences, such as favorite destinations and travel companions.

3. **Payment Integration**: Integrate a secure payment gateway to enable users to pay for bookings directly within the application.

4. **Real-time Updates**: Implement real-time flight availability updates to prevent users from booking flights that become unavailable during the booking process.

5. **Advanced Search Filters**: Enhance the flight search feature with filters for flight class, travel dates, and budget constraints.

6. **Personalized Recommendations**: Provide users with personalized travel recommendations based on their travel history and preferences.

7. **Multi-language Support**: Add support for multiple languages to cater to a wider audience of interplanetary travelers.

8. **Offline Mode**: Implement offline functionality for users to browse flights and manage bookings even without an internet connection.

9. **Feedback and Rating**: Allow users to provide feedback and rate their travel experiences, contributing to a community-driven rating system.

10. **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Integrate AR features to provide users with virtual previews of destinations, enhancing their decision-making process.
